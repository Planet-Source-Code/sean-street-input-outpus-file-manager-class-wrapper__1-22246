## Input/Outpus file manager class wrapper


</div>

### Description

This app includes a class that incapsulates the functions of reading and writing to a text file. The class handles all the functions of reading, inserting, replacing, appending, and delting data. It's been a fairly handy class for me and now I share it with you. It basically treats a text as a recordset. Procedures include:

OpenFile-opens the file

RowCount-returns the number of rows in the file

CurrentRow-returns the current row pointed at

MoveToRow-moves to indicated row

MoveFirst-moves to the first row in the text file

MoveNext-moves to the next row

MovePrevious-moves to the previous row

MoveLast-moves to the last row

GetDataFromRow-gets data from indicated row(if no row is provided then gets data from current row)

DeleteRow-deletes row indicated or current row

WriteData-inserts,replaces or appends data to text file

A few changes were made to an earlier submittion. The name I used was a bit misleading, so I changed that as well.
